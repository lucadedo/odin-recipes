        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 (8.8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons amaretto liqueur, divided</li>
            <li>1.5 cups brewed espresso, cooled</li>
            <li>1.5(12 ounce) packages ladyfingers (about 30)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. 
                Add mascarpone cheese and 2 tablespoons amaretto. 
                Beat well.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with clean beaters until stiff peaks form. 
            Fold beaten egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Pour espresso and remaining 2 tablespoons amaretto into a shallow dish. Stir well. Working one at a time, 
                quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture and line the bottom of an 8-inch glass dish.
            </li>
            <li>Once the bottom of the dish is covered in an even layer of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, 
                top with 1/2 the mascarpone mixture. Repeat with another ladyfinger layer, 
                followed by the remaining mascarpone mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Dust with cocoa powder before serving.</li>
            

        </ol>
